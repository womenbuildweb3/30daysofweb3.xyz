## Glossary

- **blockchain**: an expanding system that records transaction information in a manner that makes it hard or almost impossible to hack the system. Information gets recorded in blocks, which are like little lists of records. [Blockchain transactions explained](https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/how-transactions-get-into-the-blockchain).

- **cold wallet**: physical device that stores and protects your private keys. Not as convenient and are less accessible due to costing a fee to purchase, they provide the best security, as no one can access their contents without interacting in person with the hardware wallet. Some popular cold storage wallet options include [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/).

- **gas fee**: a transaction fee that all users must pay in order to perform a function on the blockchain. [Ethereum gas fees explained](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/ethereum-gas).

- **hot wallet**: one of the most common ways to store crypto assets and is always connected to the internet. This is a very convenient option because it's typically accessed via web, mobile, or desktop. Since hot wallets are always online, they are more vulnerable to attacks. Some popular hot wallet options include [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), and [Phantom](https://phantom.app/). 

- **mainnet**: the primary public Ethereum production blockchain used to describe when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain).

- **blockchain explorer**: an online tool that enables you to search for real-time and historical information about a blockchain, including data related to blocks, transactions, addresses, and more. Some popular blockchain explorers include [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and [PolygonScan](https://polygonscan.com/) for Mainnet transactions. 

- **recovery phrase**: aka "seed phrase" is basically a human-readable form of your wallet's private keyâ€”the unique, secret passcode used to authenticate and encrypt your wallet access. _**NEVER share your private key or recovery phrase with anyone**_.

- **smart contract**: a computer program compiled from code that can control events and actions according to the terms set within the contract's code. [Introduction to smart contracts](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html).

- **testnet**: an instance of a blockchain and only exists as a working prototype used for testing and experimentation without risk to real funds on the mainnet. Some testnet explorers include [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/) (Ethereum) and [Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) (Polygon).
