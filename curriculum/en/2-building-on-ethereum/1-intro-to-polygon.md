## Ethereum Scaling Solutions

Ethereum has become one of the most popular blockchains for a while due to its ability to employ Turing complete smart-contracts. Though, after it gained popularity there has been a significant network congestion as a result high gas fees.

## Difference Between Ethereum L1, L2 and Sidechains

**L1 Blockchain** _refers to the main blockchain layer such as Ethereum_. Layer1 scaling solutions are implemented directly on the main blockchain thus deriving the name on-chain solutions. Some examples of the on-chain scaling solution involve Consensus Protocol Switch and Sharding.

**L2 Blockchains** _are add-on solutions built on the base layer_. Thus deriving the name off-chain scaling solution, since they intend to take away workload from the blockchain while utilizing its security.

**Sidechains** are _Ethereum-compatible independent blockchains with their own consensus model_. Sidechains achieve interoperability with Ethereum by the use of the same EVM. Since they are independent from the main-chain side chains are responsible for their own security. If a sidechain’s security is compromised it will pose no impact to the mainchain.

In this program, we will focus on developing applications on the Polygon sidechain.

## What Is Polygon?

**Polygon** is _a scaling solution that achieves scale by utilizing sidechains for off-chain computation and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators._

Polygon strives to solve the scalability and usability issues while not compromising on decentralization and leveraging the existing developer community and ecosystem.

## Why Would A Developer Choose Polygon?

Ethereum can be slow and costly. Sidechains such as Polygon were created as a solution to speed up the blockchain while making minimal sacrifices on security and decentralization thus an improved user experience and reduced network congestion.
