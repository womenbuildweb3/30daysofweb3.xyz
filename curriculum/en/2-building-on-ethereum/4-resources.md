## Glossary

- **API**: stands for ["application programming interface"](https://www.guru99.com/what-is-api.html) and is a software intermediary that allows two applications to communicate with each other. 

- **Client/server architecture**: a computing model in which the [architecture](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/http-request-methods-explained/#client-server-architecture) describes how all web applications work and defines the rules for how they communicate.

- **dApp**: a decentralized application is an application built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. On Ethereum, smart contracts are accessible and transparent – like open APIs – so your dApp can even include a smart contract that someone else has written. [Introduction to dApps](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/).

- **Ethereum**: a decentralized global software platform for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting and communicating, powered by [blockchain technology](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp). Has its native cryptocurrency, Ether, or ETH, which is used to pay for certain activities on the Ethereum network.

- **HTTP**: a protocol, or a definite set of rules, for accessing resources on the web. Resources could mean anything from HTML files to data from a database, photos, text, and so on. [HTTP request methods with code examples](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/http-request-methods-explained/#client-server-architecture).

- **L1 blockchain**: refers to the main blockchain layer such as Ethereum. Layer-1 scaling solutions are implemented directly on the main blockchain, thus deriving the name on-chain solutions. Some examples of the on-chain scaling solution involve Consensus Protocol Switch and Sharding. [Introduction to Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/).

- **L2 blockchains**: [layer-2](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/) add-on solutions built on top of the base layer-1. Thus deriving the name off-chain scaling solution, since they intend to take away workload from the blockchain while utilizing its security.

- **Polygon**: a layer-2 scaling solution that achieves scale by utilizing sidechains for off-chain computation and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators. [Polygon (MATIC)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/polygon-crypto-matic-network-dapps-erc20-token) strives to solve the scalability and usability issues while not compromising on decentralization and leveraging the existing developer community and ecosystem.

- **Sidechains**: Ethereum-compatible independent blockchains with their own consensus model. [Sidechains](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/) achieve [interoperability](https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-interoperability-is-the-key-to-blockchain-technology-s-mass-adoption) with Ethereum by the use of the same EVM. Since they are independent from the main-chain, sidechains are responsible for their own security. If a sidechain’s security is compromised, it will pose no impact to the mainchain.

- **Solidity**: programming language used to build Ethereum smart contracts and can be used to deploy smart contracts on multiple chains such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, or Avalanche. [Solidity code by example](https://solidity-by-example.org/).
